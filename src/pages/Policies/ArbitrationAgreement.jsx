        MARKETTOLL Arbitration Agreement
      </h1>

      <p>
        By using MARKETTOLL, you agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy
        arising out of or relating to this agreement, your use of the App as a
        buyer or seller, or any transactions conducted through the App will be
        resolved exclusively through binding arbitration. Arbitration will be
        administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its
        Consumer Arbitration Rules for buyers or its Commercial Arbitration
        Rules for sellers, unless the parties mutually agree to a different
        arbitration provider or rules. Arbitration will be conducted by a single
        neutral arbitrator and may take place virtually or, if agreed upon, in
        person at a location convenient for all parties. <br />
        <br />
        You further agree that arbitration will proceed solely on an individual
        basis and not as part of a class, consolidated, or representative
        action. The arbitrator has no authority to consolidate claims or preside
        over class proceedings. This agreement is governed by the Federal
        Arbitration Act (FAA), and any substantive legal issues will be resolved
        in accordance with the laws of the state where MARKETTOLLLS LLC, is
        headquartered, to the extent they do not conflict with the FAA.
        <br />
        <br />
        Notwithstanding the above, you may bring an individual claim in small
        claims court if the dispute falls within its jurisdiction, or either
        party may seek injunctive relief in court to address misuse or
        infringement of intellectual property rights. For buyers, MARKETTOLLLS
        LLC will bear the costs of filing and arbitrator fees unless the
        arbitrator determines the claim was frivolous or brought in bad faith.
        For sellers, arbitration costs will be allocated as provided in the
        applicable arbitration rules. Each party is responsible for its own
        attorneysâ€™ fees unless otherwise required by law.
        <br />
        <br />
        You may opt out of this arbitration agreement by providing written
        notice to MARKETTOLLLS LLC at 2101 Vista Pkwy Ste 205 West Palm Beach,
        FL 33411 United States, within 30 days of creating your account or first
        using the App. You opt-out notice must include your name, account
        information, and a clear statement of your intent to opt out. Opting out
        will not affect any other terms of use.
        <br />
        <br />
        If any part of this arbitration agreement is found to be unenforceable,
        the remaining provisions will remain in effect. However, if the class
        action waiver is found to be unenforceable, this entire arbitration
        agreement will be null and void. By using MARKETTOLL, you confirm that
        you have read, understand, and agree to this arbitration agreement.
